        RNS has a tiered pricing model that is priced in USDC and then converted to ROOT using pricing oracles based on the latest ROOT/USDC price at the time of purchase.

        Pricing:

        5+ letter/digit/emoji/symbol names per year - 5 USDC or ROOT equivalent

        4 letter/digit/emoji/symbol names per year - 50 USDC or ROOT equivalent

        3 letter/digit/emoji/symbol names per year - 150 USDC or ROOT equivalent

        2 letter/digit/emoji/symbol names per year - 350 USDC or ROOT equivalent

        1 letter/digit/emoji/symbol names per year - 750 USDC or ROOT equivalent

        The registration period carries over to the new holder/wallet. For the avoidance of doubt, if you have registered your RNS for 1 year and after 3 months decide to sell your RNS or transfer it to a new wallet then the remaining 9 months registration period carries over to the new holder/wallet.

        subheading: `
        Yes, regardless of the duration you choose to register your RNS for, the transaction fee remains the same. That means if you choose to renew your RNS every year over a period of 5 years, you will incur total transaction fees that are five times higher than if you had registered it just once for the entire 5-year period.
